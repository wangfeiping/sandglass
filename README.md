# Sandglass 沙漏
  
Hope to write an interesting science fiction novel!
  
I love science fiction and love all the parallel universe stories, but I've been a little tired of it lately.
So I'm going to write a story in my head, which isn't about parallel universes, but hopefully it's interesting enough for readers to find it as well.
  
The story is completely free and maybe NFTs will be minted later. NFTs are used to thank readers who have provided valuable feedback.
If this story generates some gains, I hope to distribute the benefits to those who hold NFTs. It is not yet possible to know for sure.

Finally, the name of the story is Sandglass / 沙漏.
